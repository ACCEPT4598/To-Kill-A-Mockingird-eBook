<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:73.99px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt, his hair</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:117.73px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I towered over him. As he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:139.60px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">darken; his laugh was sudden and happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:362.70px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">found acceptable. Thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment. Routine</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:384.57px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">contentment was: improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:414.53px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">when it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:436.40px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">wasn’t crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:458.27px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Radley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:480.14px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">a criminal. The sheriff hadn’t the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:502.01px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Boo was locked in the courthouse basement.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:571.99px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">didn’t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:593.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">not live forever on the bounty of the county.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:641.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">sight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the bed most of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:663.85px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">time. Atticus said no, it wasn’t that sort of thing, that there were other ways of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:685.71px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">making people into ghosts.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:711.96px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">My memory came alive to see Mrs. Radley occasionally open the front door, walk</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:69.61px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:410.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the sawhorses were taken away, and we stood watching from the front porch</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:572.62px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">took Mr. Radley’s place. The only difference between him and his father was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:236.45px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">judging from his tracks; he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:258.32px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">that’s why his hands were bloodstained—if you ate an animal raw, you could</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:280.19px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">never wash the blood off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face;</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:560.13px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">to put your big toe in the front yard.” Jem said he reckoned he wasn’t, he’d passed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:143.35px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Jem held up the bottom wire and motioned Dill under it. I followed, and held up</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:165.22px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">the wire for Jem. It was a tight squeeze for him. “Don’t make a sound,” he</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:383.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">We spat ourselves dry, and Jem opened the gate slowly, lifting it aside and resting</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:279.60px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">School started. The second grade was as bad as the first, only worse—they still</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:367.08px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">only thing good about the second grade was that this year I had to stay as late as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:388.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Jem, and we usually walked home together at three o’clock.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:415.19px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">One afternoon when we were crossing the schoolyard toward home, Jem suddenly</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:437.06px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">said: “There’s something I didn’t tell you.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:463.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">As this was his first complete sentence in several days, I encouraged him: “About</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:511.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">“About that night.”</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:563.93px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Jem waved my words away as if fanning gnats. He was silent for a while, then he</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:193.84px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Jem let me do the honors: I pulled out two small images carved in soap. One was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:47.12px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">existence of its own. It worked separate and apart from the rest of her, out and in,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:68.99px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">like a clam hole at low tide. Occasionally it would say, “Pt,” like some viscous</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:165.22px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Jem said, “Mrs. Dubose, are you all right?” She did not hear him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:191.47px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">The alarm clock went off and scared us stiff. A minute later, nerves still tingling,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:213.34px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Jem and I were on the sidewalk headed for home. We did not run away, Jessie</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:283.33px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">“Shoo,” she said, “you all go home.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:309.58px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Jem hesitated at the door.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:335.83px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">“It’s time for her medicine,” Jessie said. As the door swung shut behind us I saw</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:357.69px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Jessie walking quickly toward Mrs. Dubose’s bed.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:383.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">It was only three forty-five when we got home, so Jem and I drop-kicked in the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:405.81px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">back yard until it was time to meet Atticus. Atticus had two yellow pencils for me</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:528.30px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">“She can’t help that. When people are sick they don’t look nice sometimes.”</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:60.87px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Atticus’s face was grave. “Has somebody been calling you that?”</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:187.74px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">“Then why are you asking me what it means?”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:213.99px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I tried to explain to Atticus that it wasn’t so much what Francis said that had</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:283.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">“Scout,” said Atticus, “nigger-lover is just one of those terms that don’t mean</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:305.85px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">anything—like snot-nose. It’s hard to explain—ignorant, trashy people use it</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:394.53px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">against the front door. He was sitting in one of his office chairs, and he was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:73.99px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">then he turned and strolled back to the witness stand. From long years of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:95.85px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">experience, I could tell he was trying to come to a decision about something.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:122.10px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">“Miss Mayella,” he said, smiling, “I won’t try to scare you for a while, not yet.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:170.22px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">“Said I was nineteen, said it to the judge yonder.” Mayella jerked her head</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:192.09px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">resentfully at the bench.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:218.34px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">“So you did, so you did, ma’am. You’ll have to bear with me, Miss Mayella, I’m</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:288.33px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I could see nothing in Mayella’s expression to justify Atticus’s assumption that he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:310.19px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">had secured her wholehearted cooperation. She was looking at him furiously.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:415.19px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Judge Taylor said, “Mr. Finch is not making fun of you. What’s the matter with</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:463.31px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Mayella looked from under lowered eyelids at Atticus, but she said to the judge:</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:642.64px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">polite. That’s just his way.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:668.89px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">The judge leaned back. “Atticus, let’s get on with these proceedings, and let the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:257.08px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">as the doors of the Radley Place. A deserted, waiting, empty street, and the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:278.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">courtroom was packed with people. A steaming summer night was no different</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:300.81px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">from a winter morning. Mr. Heck Tate, who had entered the courtroom and was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:366.42px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">of a chair; as he listened to what Mr. Tate was saying, he ran his hand slowly up</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:388.28px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">and down his thigh. I expected Mr. Tate to say any minute, “Take him, Mr.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:436.40px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">But Mr. Tate said, “This court will come to order,” in a voice that rang with</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:161.46px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Gilmer, and then went to Tom Robinson and whispered something to him. Atticus</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:227.07px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">not by his usual exit. He must have wanted to go home the short way, because he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:248.94px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">walked quickly down the middle aisle toward the south exit. I followed the top of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:171.47px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">reasons. For one thing, Miss Maudie can’t serve on a jury because she’s a woman</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:388.28px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">It was only a fantasy. We would never see him. He probably did go out when the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:383.90px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Each child was supposed to clip an item from a newspaper, absorb its contents,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:332.10px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I said it more to convince myself than Jem, for sure enough, as we began walking,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:353.97px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I heard what he was talking about. It was not my costume.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:380.22px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">“It’s just old Cecil,” said Jem presently. “He won’t get us again. Let’s don’t let</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:83.37px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Mr. Tate sniffed. He glanced sharply at the man in the corner, nodded to him, then</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:293.33px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">back yard, and Atticus would often keep appointments on the back steps. This one</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:315.19px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">was probably more comfortable where he was.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:73.44px;top:504.69px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Dr. Reynolds was carrying a big package wrapped in newspaper. He put it down</span></div>
